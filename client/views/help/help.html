        The Feature Switch UI prototype uses <a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a>,
        a reactive framework that runs on Node.js on the server with MongoDB for persistence. It does live
        page updates with background data syncronization using MiniMongo on the client. As you make
        changes in the UI, the data is synchronized with the MongoDB on the server, and the server
        updates other clients that are viewing the data.

        <p/> This is a UI prototype. Your changes will be saved to the MongoDB on the server, but no
        applications are using the feature switches. Feel free to experiment!

        This describes how to use the custom feature settings.
        <p/>
        The Feature Switch Service determines if a feature is active by checking the status, scope, percentage, and groups
        fields, in that order.
        <ol>
            <li>
                Status: if the feature is switched off, it's off for all users.
            </li>
            <li>
                Scope: if the feature is active for all users, the percentage and groups values are ignored. The feature
                is enabled for all users, and the values of the other fields don't matter.
                <br/>Check "Custom" to enable the percentage and groups controls.
            </li>
            <li>
                Percentage: The feature is enabled for a percentage of users. For example, if the percentage is 10, then
                10 percent of users will have the feature enabled. If the percentage is later changed to 20, the original
                10 percent will still get the feature, plus an additional 10 percent. The pool of users that get the
                feature is pseudo-random, based on their accont ID and the feature name. This helps ensure that the
                10 percent see Feature X are not the same 10 percent that see Feature Y.
            </li>
            <li>
                Groups: if Active for Groups is checked, and the feature was not enabled by the earlier criteria, the
                account ID is compared with selected group account IDs. (Use the Groups tab to manage groups). A group
                contains a list of account IDs. The feature is enabled if the users account ID is contained in a
                selected group.
            </li>
        </ol>

        Enter one account ID per line. Comments may appear after the account ID
        with a space separator.
